# Really protect from ransomware encryption?
We see many anti-virus / next generation endpoints claim ransomware protection, they are high ranking, expensive, feature rich, detail EDR and granular control

 BUT CANNOT detect ransomware encryption operation, whole office computers and servers being locked.

Those vendors explain you should turn on all block mode, make sure all computer have the endpoint software, keep computer patch up to date, review log regulaerly, follow up abnormal event, then most of invasion can be stopped.

How many company in the world can 100% archive this.

# Which brand can really protect?

That's why I develop this tool, not to replicate found malware, no footprint in signature, just do encrypt and delete.

I hope to find it.

It is safe enough to run it on your working PC and server, let you see the fact in your environment.

Luckly, I found few brands can do, and one of them can stop ransomware encryption initiated from remote PC via file share and RDP as well.  Amazing!

# Caution

This tool encrypts the files under running folder and subfolder, you may create a temperate folder like C:\Encrypt-Delete-Test\, save this tool to there, then run it.  Be safe.
