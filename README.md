# Really protect from ransomware encryption?
We see many anti-virus / next generation endpoints claim ransomware protection, they are high ranking, expensive, feature rich, detail EDR and granular control but cannot detect ransomware encryption operation, whole office PC being locked.

Those vendors explain you should turn on all block mode, make sure all computer have the endpoint software, keep computer patch up to date, then most of invasion can be stopped.

But how many IT operator can archive 100%.




# Which brand can really detect and stop ransomware encryption?

That's why I develop this tool, not to replicate found malware, no signature, just do encrypt and delete.

I hope to find it.

It is safe enough to run it on your working PC and server, let you see the fact in your environment.

Luckly, I found few brands can do.
